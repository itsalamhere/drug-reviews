    "In this project, we'll be exploring the dataset and clean them for the purpose of dashboard and sentiment prediction. To recall, the data has been collected from [drugs.com](drugs.com) and stored in a single CSV file by [Ahmed et al., (2023)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/64cc5w5dxy/1) . The dataset contains 392510 unique reviews along with:\n",
    "- `MedicineName` -- the name of the drug,\n",
    "- `MedicineFor` -- the condition for which the drug was taken,\n",
    "- `ReviewDate` -- when the review's posted,\n",
    "- `UserName` -- who posted the review,\n",
    "- `IntakeTime` -- how long the drug was taken for,\n",
    "- `Reviews` -- how the user perceives the drug,\n",
    "- `ReviewLength` -- how many characters are in the reviews,\n",
    "- `Rating` -- score by the user, scaled from `1-10`,\n",
    "- `NumberOfLikes` -- the credibility of the review in the form of likes. \n",

She put me on Trokendi XR and told me it would help with the binge eating and OMG has it! Not only has it changed the taste of foods where before foods I would normally eat all of in one sitting I now only eat a literal serving size of and don't physically want anymore and most times don't even want to eat unless I'm physically hungry. I HIGHLY recommend trying this instead of surgery or letting them put you in a hospital if you an overeating problem. Surgery should be a LAST resort! Good luck to all! <3  \n",

Overall I have had a very positive response to duloxetine. Side effects: There is the initial fatigue & a lot of yawning. That went away after about 3 weeks. I had difficulty peeing during the night. This faded over time. Difficulty to orgasm after I went up to 90mg this faded after a few weeks.  "

My dermatologist recommend it to me as a last resort before getting Botox shots. I was hesitant because I've tried Driclor Perspirex and CertainDri and they've lost their longevity in a matter of days and didn't work for me but Drysol seems to prove different. It doesn't really burn much and dries fast and it keeps me dry with every application I've used and so far almost a month of using it's and it's still working wonders! I feel all the other hyperhidrosis antiperspirants I've used in the past can't even compete because they're complete knock off's compared to Drysol! I'm so happy I was prescribed this! I highly recommend it!</td>\n",

I promised myself I would come here and tell my story if I got my period. I had sex on the very LAST day of my ovulation &amp; the condom had slipped off at some point. I had no idea when I took the My Way pill that the whole point of the pill was to slow down your ovulation so I thought it was too late for me. I took it around 17 hours after it happened. No symptoms from this except sore breasts but everybody’s body is different. My period was 3 days late &amp; finally came this morning I cried. I'm not sure if pill is what prevented the pregcy or if i just got lucky but I'm thankful I'm not pregt. Try to not dwell on the thought you might be pregt it just causes unnecessary stress.

I've never been on anything else really so I can't speak to other drugs but I feel like I got my life back. I did notice it would wear off for me around 3 in the afternoon though and the doctor put me on a low dose of Dextroamphetamine at 2:30 to supplement the rest of the day. So far so good. I don't want to take higher and higher doses so I try to stay where I'm at and make that work. Most days it does. Great drug for me.\n",

I gained so much weight with it and ITS SO HARD TO LOOSE WEIGHT WITH KYLEENA. Also vaginal dryness was awful I constantly had yeast infection --filtered_1 makysIf you find yourself here reading these reviews then you are probably going through the same as I recently was. I promised myself I would come here and tell my story if I got my period. I had sex on the very LAST day of my ovulation & the condom had slipped off at some point. I had no idea when I took the My Way pill that the whole point of the pill was to slow down your ovulation so I thought it was too late for me. I took it around 17 hours after it happened. No symptoms from this except sore breasts but everybody’s body is different. My period was 3 days late & finally came this morning I cried. I'm not sure if pill is what prevented the pregcy or if i just got lucky but I'm thankful I'm not pregt. Try to not dwell on the thought you might be pregt it just causes unnecessary stress. Remember to try & stay positive even though it is hard. I have learned a big lesson from this experience & I hope reading this brought u a little comfort because god knows I needed it<3\n",
