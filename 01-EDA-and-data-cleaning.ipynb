    "Data science applications in healthcare can offer us a good amount of interesting insights to the stakeholders. Aside from more-advanced applications to health workers to such as predictive analytics, medical imaging, and drug research, data such as customers' sales and reviews in healthcare products can also be used by pharma and medical device companies in evaluating their market or product.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll be exploring the dataset of from Ahmed et al., (2023). The dataset contains 392510 unique reviews along with the name of the drug, user rating, the credibility of the review in the form of likes, length of the reviews, the condition for which the drug was taken and how long the drug was taken for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be divided into 4 main sections:\n",
    "1. `01-EDA-and-data-cleaning` *(this one)*, where we'll be cleaning the data for future purposes of sentiment prediction and dashboard\n",
    "2. `02-import-csv-to-postgresql`, where we'll be transferring the cleaned data into PostgreSQL database--a lighter size (for dashboard)\n",
    "3. `03-drug-reviews-dashboard`, where the data will be interfaced on a Tableau dashboard for a more convenient interface, and lastly\n",
    "4. `04-sentiment-prediction`, where we're utilizing Deep Learning to predict sentiments towards a product.\n",

I take 10mg of olanzapine with 75mg effexor each day. The combination is quite effective compared with antidepressant mono-therapy. I wish I'd been on this combination long ago. Helps particularly with suicidal thoughts and getting a new perspective on depressive thought processes. It also starts working faster than antidepressants which was important in my case.  \n",

I would wake up in the middle of the night with nausea but that was expected by my Dr. I got my period in May it was short and fairly light (I used to have terribly heavy periods). I didn’t get my period in June though and it’s now July so I’m hoping it comes. I personally don’t like the fact it doesn’t come regularly because I think every woman has a small “what if I'm pregt” thought in the back of their heads lol. I’ve been reading a lot of reviews and most say they don’t get their period more than 2-4 times per year... kinda scary but also kinda puts me more at ease. Other than that I don’t experience any side effects and I’m only moody once in a while  \n",

The insertion does hurt but it’s nothing out of ordinary and the moment where I felt pain lasted less than a minute it felt more like a sharp pain than a severe cramp. My first period after the insertion lasted for 11 days (usually it’s like 5) and I have been a bit more hormonal and tired than normal but I guess it’s just my body accommodating. Two weeks after the insertion I saw my doctor for a check-up and she said my IUD had moved farther up than where she placed it don’t know why but apparently it’s nothing to worry about.

I will say within an hour of taking one 145 mcg pill I was running to the bathroom and let's just say it was a close call. Thankfully I took my first dose on a Sunday as I had no plans. I had diarrhea bloating abdominal pain nausea and fatigue all day. As my body adjusted to it my symptoms seemed to lessen BUT I still have the explosive diarrhea about 1-2 hours after taking it. Also I work a very busy job with very few chances for a break but somehow I have always been able to go when I feel the urge. I am going to continue taking this as long as my insurance covers it!!\n",

They didn't help so I picked up M7 b/c I read that it has the least side effects. LIES!!! The first night I was in so much pain. My legs were shaking and I was breathing like I was going into labor.

I was in tears in bed for the second night as well. I have never hated being a woman in my whole LIFE. But on the third morning I felt normal again! I didn’t even have to use the 3rd dose!

       "295398  I drank it pretty quickly  it made me nausea I felt like throwing up and I felt extremely cold  but it worked very quickly. I didn't eat the day before or day off based on the instructions from the Drs office . I started 1st dose at 7 30 PM and 2nd dose at 7 30 AM meanwhile the 1st dose was still working when I woke up  causes stomach cramps gurgling --filtered_1 EliseTaken for less than 1 monthMy first colonoscopy and was unsure what to expect and felt a bit scared. For three days before I followed a low-fiber diet and ate minimally which I believe helped with this. Liquid diet 24 hours before. Took the first dose at 1 pm took an hour for bowel movements to start and went maybe 8-10 times very watery. Didn't think the taste was that bad tbh I just followed it with lemonade and water. Took the second dose at 5 pm and this was harder did feel nauseous taking this but drank it slow and kept it down don't panic or think you're going to vomit just drink fresh water too. Drank another 3 liters or so on top of this and went to the loo maybe every 5-10mins for around 4.5 hours. Managed to get to sleep at 11:30 pm and then had to wake at 5:30 am for 2 further bowel movements. Left for an appointment at 7 am and went once again at the hospital and had a colonoscopy at 8 am. Still have watery BM after but it's going to take a few days for my stomach to return to normal I'd expect. Not a bad experience but obviously not fun.\n",

I've been using pain meds with varying degrees of success for about 40 years. About a year ago the pain clinic decided to put me on Xtampza 9. They know I cannot sleep after taking pain meds as they give me energy so I take both in the morning. I get no pain relief but what surprised me was also no energy I can sleep even after taking 2 but cannot sleep after 1/2 hydrocodone 5/325. I can take 3 days off of the Xtampza and feel no difference. 1/2 a hydrocodone 5/325 gives me better pain relief something is not right here.

I had tried many different medications and it was the one medication that I responded to at the time. I started out on 0.5mg and slowly increased my dosage to 2mg. It worked for a while but then stopped working. It also made me feel flat and sedated. My doctor added a stimulant (Adderall) to counteract the sedation which only helped a little. We tried adding on other antidepressants with not much response. Any time I started a new antidepressant I would feel more sedated (now I realize it was a drug interaction with the Rexulti).\n",

I'll take the cancer any day over the paralysis. I was taking 4mg of Dilaudid every 4 hours in rehab which was debilitating (to me). I'm starting to build up a tolerance to roxicodone --filtered_1 Anonymous0016unregistered:\n",
